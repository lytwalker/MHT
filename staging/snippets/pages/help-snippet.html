            <h3>How often should I wash my hair extensions?</h3>
            <p>Your extension hair should only be washed between 2-3 times per week.</p>
            <p>Before washing it is advised to detangle your extension hair with a wide tooth comb and separate the bonds.</p>
            <p>It is essential you only use shampoo and conditioner that is designed for hair extension use.</p>
            <p>When washing your hair, do not tip your head over the bath as this could cause tangling - always wash with your head upright – in the shower is ideal. Smooth the shampoo down the extension hair – do not rub vigorously! Only condition from the mid lengths to the end of the hair. Do not apply any conditioner to the bonds as this will cause slippage.</p>
            <p>You can pick the top section of your own hair up and apply condition to this section. Pat hair gently when washed – do not rub.</p>
